# filesystem-template-ext

This is a simple ext project to help speed up local template development in Liferay. 

Instead of having to update templates in the Liferay UI this ext modifies code so that the portal will directly look at the fileystem instead. This way as soon as you save any template changes in a text editor of your choice, the portal will reflect those changes.
